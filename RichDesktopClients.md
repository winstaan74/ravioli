# Introduction #

Is there any use in implementing OSX Dashboard Widgets / Google Gadgets / Microsoft Sidebar Gadgets that integrate into the site -e.g.
  * list your bookmarks
  * allow you to do a quick reg. search (results open in website)
  * notifying of changes / updates from other collaborators

or something else altogether?
