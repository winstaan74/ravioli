= Introduction =
A web 2.0 equivalent to the core functionality of VOExplorer.


= Notes = 

Requires a searchable registry as the back end - so maybe implementing a registry harvester is the first task, which constructs a registry resource archive.

I'm unsure whether XQuery and eXist (although I'd like to play with both of them) are really needed for this. Grails very closely integrates with relational databases - if I used an xmldatabase, I'd lose a lot of this functionality (which will be important when the application comes to cover tagging / private resources / etc).

Instead, I suspect the standard grails plugin [http://www.grails.org/Searchable+Plugin Searchable] provides enough functionlity to implement the registry resource archive. Doing this means we can remove the xmldb altogether.
