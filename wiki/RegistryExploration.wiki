#summary Equivalent behaviour to VOExplorer
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =
A web 2.0 equivalent to the core functionality of VOExplorer.
AJAX-style interaction - minimizes page refreshes.

= Features =
A left-hand list of folders - precanned and user-defined - to select from.

A query builder - displays possible values for each search term, lets users easily add new search terms to refine the search.
   * a novel search term gives astroscope-like functionaity - provides an estimate of how many resources each service will return for a given position.

A 'save' button that allows a query to be saved to the left-hand list of folders.

A table that displays summaries of matching resources
  * Basic implementation done - later needs a way of altering which columns are shown

On clicking on an item in the table, expand to display a formatted description of the resource.
   * integrate with other web services where possible - e.g. when bibcode, link to pdf found through ADS

= Unknowns =
How to compute the list of possible values, given the user's existing query. Need to investigate this.
