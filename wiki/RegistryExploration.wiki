#summary Equivalent behaviour to VOExplorer
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =
A web 2.0 equivalent to the core functionality of VOExplorer.


= Notes = 

Instead, I suspect the standard grails plugin [http://www.grails.org/Searchable+Plugin Searchable] provides enough functionlity to implement the registry resource archive. Doing this means we can remove the xmldb altogether. 

= Features =
A left-hand list of folders - precanned and user-defined - to select from.

A query builder - displays possible values for each search term, lets users easily add new search terms to refine the search.

A 'save' button that allows a query to be saved to the left-hand list of folders.

A table that displays summaries of matching resources
  * Basic implementation done - later needs a way of altering which columns are shown

On clicking on an item in the table, expand to display a formatted description of the resource.


= Unknowns =
How to compute the list of possible values, given the user's existing query. Need to investigate this.
