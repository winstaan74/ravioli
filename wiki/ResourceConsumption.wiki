= Introduction =

Once the registry has been explored, how are the selected resources consumed?
  * ~~Samp messaging~~
  * ~~integrating other websites~~
  * ~~passing to 3rd party applets~~


= Details =

~~We've decided to offer this functionality in-place wherever possible - inline the operations with the resource description, rather than have a separate 'action' pane, as with voexplorer. This means that operations can be more strongly associated with the particular capability they're going to operate upon.~~

For the minority 'bulk' actions, provide a checkbox column in the resource table, tick the resources of interest, and then trigger an action from a menu along the top (as seen in gmail)

~~Don't want to provide too much functionality ourselves - instead hand-off to helper applications.~~

~~Samp messaging - I've restarted the discussion of a samp message for voresources with Yulie and MarkT. Now that topcat provides cone search, etc, I thnk this might go somewhere.~~
