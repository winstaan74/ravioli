= Introduction =

Once the registry has been explored, how are the selected resources consumed?
  * Samp messaging
  * integrating other websites
  * passing to 3rd party applets

Do we need to implement any 'helper apps' in webpages?

= Details =

We've decided to offer this functionality in-place wherever possible - inline the operations with the resource description, rather than have a separate 'action' pane, as with voexplorer. This means that operations can be more strongly associated with the particular capability they're going to operate upon.

Don't want to provide too much functionality ourselves - instead hand-off to helper applications.

Samp messaging - I've restarted the discussion of a samp messgage with Yulie and MarkT.
