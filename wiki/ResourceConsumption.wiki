= Introduction =

Once the registry has been explored, how are the selected resources consumed?
  * Samp messaging
  * integrating other websites
  * passing to 3rd party applets

Do we need to implement any 'helper apps' in webpages?

= Details =

We've decided to offer this functionality in-place wherever possible - inline the operations with the resource description, rather than have a separate 'action' pane, as with voexplorer. This means that operations can be more strongly associated with the particular capability they're going to operate upon.

For the minority 'bulk' actions, provide a checkbox column in the resource table, tick the resources of interest, and then trigger an action from a menu along the top (as seen in gmail)

Don't want to provide too much functionality ourselves - instead hand-off to helper applications.

Samp messaging - I've restarted the discussion of a samp messgage with Yulie and MarkT.
