=Introduction=
We need to think of a name for the deployed website - the thing we present to users.

_Ravioli_ is just the working name for the project / codebase. Although it contains 'R' for registry, and 'VO', I don't know if it's suitable.

  * How about _n√©osan_ (OK, _neosan_) - Old English word meaning "to search" or "to find out"? (Keith)
