I want an xml database that is queriable using [ XQuery]

Suspect we should use [http://www.exist-db.org/ eXist], but where's the evidence? There's other alternatives out there - 
  * http://basex.org/ - possible
  * --http://xml.apache.org/xindice/-- - nope, doesn't support XQuery, seems dead
  * http://monetdb.cwi.nl/XQuery/
  * http://www.ozone-db.org/frames/home/what.html - nope. different core rationale (OO-DB)
  * http://modis.ispras.ru/sedna/index.html - looks like there's interest in this.

ugh! - can't find a performance / ease of use comparison anywhere.
