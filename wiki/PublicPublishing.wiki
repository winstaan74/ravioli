Public publishing of tables and images.

 Done with a
standard-style web wizard : multi-page workflow. Eg for a cone
search : user names URL where a table can be found (could be any
format that Topcat understands ?).  Then you fill in stuff for the
resource entry. Then our software produces the DSA service. The data
stays where it is, but the services runs on our server. Finally we
publish the resource entry.  For a SIAP its similar, but we have to
crawl over a (flat) collection of FITS images to make an index table.
Needs some careful thought about atlas vs cutout etc.

problem is that the source data must be publicly accessible - so can't use this solution for consortium / group scoped publishing.

Should implement the harvesting interface, so that other registries can access these (public) new resources
  * provides a convenient way to register your own services.

Should we allow users to register any kind of service? upload XML resource description?
