#summary Andy's feedback for 0.6

=Saved searches=
Pre-canned searches definietly good, and yes they can be longer. But
there could be a lot, especially if people start sharing them. So we
need some structure .. folders ?
"All Vizier" .. or "All Heasarc" which would also be good ... is
conecptually different. This is as you say a starting point, whereas
the others are worke examples so you get the idea.

We can re-think the pre-canned lists. OK for nwo.

For a smart list, you can see how its done in the search box.
For static lists, I think having a query that says "this AND that AND
this AND that AND this..." is unhelpful. We need a way to jump to a
simple ivo-id list.
This is important. I think build-a-list by drag and drop will be very
popular. I do it all the time in VO Desktop.

=stuff missing=
 * VO taster has 4/15 cf Vo Desktop list
 * cone search examples has 6 vs 11, image access 6 vs 10...
 * is publisher:CDS the same as "all Vizier" ... ? CDS do other things

 * ability list : yes, nice ... but waht is the difference between an
ability and a capability ?

=SAMP=
... before demoing in Heidelberg, it would be really nice if the SAMP
bit is fixed...
