Publishing Tables and Images just to a group
  * registration
  * trust of our service
  * security of underlying data
    * depends critically on StateOfVospaceAndCommunity
    * and a little on StateOfSampTools

Maybe there's work-arounds - such as a download-from-vospace client, that runs on user's desktop?

 We don't have a good
solution to this yet. The problem is that the data needs to be on a
public FTP server, so it is protected only by obscurity. Solution (i)
let people do it as above, but don't put entry in public registry.
Advise them that this could expose their data. (ii) Offer to host the
data as well as the DSA service. Maybe we could do this for small
tables, but not huge datasets. (iii) Put data on sftp or https, and
have user interrupted by a request for a password ? won't work well (iv) Wait
for VOSpace ... (v) some magic with single use URLs?
