#summary User Tagging / Annotating of registry resources.
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Resource Tagging =
allow the user to add tags, notes, comments, flag, even attach files (e.g. sample inputs, queries) to resources.
  
Once we have GroupManagement, each annotation may be shared with none or more of the groups the user belongs to.
  * if a user leaves a group, their annotations are no longer available to members of that group.

annotations from others in your group are attributed - you can see who made the annotation.

is a 'don't show annotations from this user'  option necessary - if the groups become very large?

= Tagging of other things = 
Could we use ravioli to enable users to tag/point to other things? - particular db tables, or even rows in db tables?
  * links in with idea of named subsets in topcat
