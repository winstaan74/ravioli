can integrate an off-the-shelf wiki plugin for this kind of thing.


# All kinds of possibilities... #
  * instant messaging
  * tweets
  * mailing list
    * keep as separate google group
  * whiteboard / wiki
  * [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/) - a blend of most of the above
  * Blogs - is this our problem?
