# Introduction #
We need to think of a name for the deployed website - the thing we present to users.

_Ravioli_ is just the working name for the project / codebase. Although it contains 'R' for registry, and 'VO', I don't know if it's suitable.

See [10 Tips for how to name your project](http://www.wynia.org/wordpress/2006/06/10-tips-for-how-to-name-your-project/)

  * How about _n√©osan_ (OK, _neosan_) - Old English word meaning "to search" or "to find out"? (Keith)
