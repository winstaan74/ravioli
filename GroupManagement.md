(crossed out what we've already done)
# Introduction #
Add users and groups to the registry browser

# Functionality #
user profile used to store
  * ~~user's preferences on how to display the UI (which table columns, default number of results, etc)~~
  * user's own set of resource lists

Any content created by a user can be shared - on creation, user is asked which, if any, of his groups to make it available to.

# Creating Groups #
Anybody can create a new group. Maybe more than person should be allowed to 'own' a group, and decide memberships?

Group titles and descriptions are searchable, but membership is not.

You can request to join one, and the group owner
decides.

> You can be in multiple groups.

You can decide to leave a group, or group owner can remove you from group.

> Queries and lists belonging to
a group show by default as a folder, so you see them when you expand.
