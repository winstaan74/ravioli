# Google Web Toolkit (GWT) #

[Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) seems to be the best choice for the presentation layer. Integrates nicely with Grails, and looks good, without requiring flash.

The [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit) lists a bunch of add-on projects that provide further widgets and functionality for GWT - I need to investigate these.
