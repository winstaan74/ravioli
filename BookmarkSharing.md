# Introduction #
When creating a stored query (a smart or static list), it's possible to choose to share this with one of the groups you are a member of.

not shared editable at first though - this gets complex...

# Further thoughts #

  * What else is it possible to bookmark
    * vospace locations, ftp locations?
    * stored queries? - i.e. a position query on a cone service?

  * how are these other kinds of bookmarks represented?
    * as user-created registry resources?
      * means they can be filtered / shared / managed like other private resources
    * or as magic links in the resourcefolders list?
